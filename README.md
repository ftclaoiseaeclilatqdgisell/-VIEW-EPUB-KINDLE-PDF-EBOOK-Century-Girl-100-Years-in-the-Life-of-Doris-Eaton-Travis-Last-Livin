Lauren Redniss, acclaimed author of the brilliant biography-in-collage Radioactive, delivers a stunning visual journey through the life of the last Ziegfeld girl, Doris Eaton Travis. Now in paperback for the first time, Century Girl spans the brightest moments in early show business, the major historical landmarks of the 20th century, and the intimate milestones of one woman‚Äôs long life. Incorporating hundreds of archival photos and personal clippings with inventive line drawings and a compelling, hand-written narrative, Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2006
Review: Everything about this vivacious book gives me a thrill. From the life and times of Doris Eaton herself (my latest and greatest role model - Please, God, let me live so long and be so grand!) to Ms. Redniss' swell and funky collaged interpretations of it, these are book dollars well-spent. Century Girl is a BIG, juicy tome of a book with a fabulous and sturdy library binding and thick glossy pages.

Whether you're a fan of cutting edge book design, collage, the 1920's, or the Ziegfield Follies, do your coffee or bedside table a sweet favor and grace it with this book before another week passes you by. And don't forget the tables at your Aunties' and your best girlfriends'.

This is a book to give anyone you're really crazy about.

Title: Lauren Redness is AMAZING!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2012
Review: Lauren Redniss knows that personal stories and historical understanding are conveyed best by appealing to all of our senses. In this ground-breaking biography, she incorporates primary sources such as old photographs and vintage newspaper clippings, along with her original drawings and hand-lettered ribbons of prose, and combines them into a creative collage of wonderful story-telling. It's fun, imaginative, well-researched, and, most importantly, tells Doris Eaton Travis's life story more vividly and memorably than conventional fonts or illustrations ever could. Her more recent book, "Radioactive," is just as imaginative and fascinating, although the Marie Curie story is much more somber and thought-provoking. Both these books will stay with you long after you read them, and will hopefully have a lasting influence on history writing in general.

Title: CRAZY format you will LOVE or HATE.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2013
Review: The author took a big chance on writing this fascinating biography in the format of a fact and photo packed scrapbook, as if it was a collection of clippings and photos treasured by the subject herself. The informative text is a personal account of the subject's total life adventure, including intimate details of her family as well as the behind the scenes history of the Ziegfeld Follies, Vaudeville and Burlesque as it evolved in her lifetime. Like nothing I have ever seen, the story appears as hand-printed letters wrapping and bending to fill every bit of paper between the hand cut-out silhouettes and shapes of the news clippings and historical photos. Large format book with high quality paper, printing and binding.

Title: Wonderful book, can be a bit hard to read.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2017
Review: I love this book.I love dance history, especially Follies and Doris is fascinating. However the written content was *very* hard for me to read. I have mild dyslexia which made it difficult..The photos and artwork were fabulous but I would love it if there were a version with regular typeface in paragraphs (I realize that is not the book's intended aesthetic.) Again - I loved the book, but it was a real challenge for me to read.

Review: What an interesting life, and beautiful picture book to memorialize this woman and her incredible show-biz upbringing. Some of the more memorable bits for me are: one sister earning $5k a week as a head-lining Ziegfeld Girl in about 1920, the menagerie Ziegfeld had in his wild NY apartment(s), she and her siblings and Mom living apart from Dad and the non-showbiz sibs, for years, and how sad that was, and ultimately how many tragic endings in this family, including an unsolved murder of one sister, the oldest sister surviving all her children, and the collecting/hoarding habits that seemed to effect all the seniors in the family.

Title: Terribly put together book- pass it up
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020
Review: If it wasn't for the pictures I wouldn't even give it one star! The entire book was handwritten diagonally. It made me dizzy, and it made the whole story experience was terrible.
